Widgets
=======

Notes on widgets:

- CMF-compatible skins are stored in skins/cpsportlets_widgets.

- CPS3-specific skins are stored in skins/cpsportlets_widgets_cps3.

- Plone2-specific skins are stored in skins/cpsportlets_widgets_plone2.

The CPS3 (or the Plone2) skin is installed on top of the CMF skin.

Page templates / python scripts
===============================

- The page templates are used for the presentation. They should be
  generic and cross-platform unless the presentation differs
  between platforms.

- The python scripts are used to prepare the data that will be
  presented.

Specific implementations (CPS3/Plone) should be done in the
scripts not in the page templates.

For instance we write:

- showData.pt::

      ...
      <div tal:define="data here/getData" tal:content="data/title" />
      ...

with the ``getData.py`` file located in skins/cpsportlets_widgets, in
skins/cpsportlets_widgets_plone2 and in skins/cpsportlets_widgets_cps3.

- getData.py::

      title = ...
      return {'title': title}


Instead of::

- showData.pt:

      <div tal:define="data here/getCPSData" tal:content="data/title" />


i18n
----

i18n is compatible. Use Localizer (not for a long time) if Localizer is
present. Otherwise, the po are PlacelessTranslationService compliant.


CPS4CMFPlone
============

You'll need either to install the build package CPS4CMFPlone or
either install the following:

- CPSchemas
- CPSDocument
- CPSInstaller

Check the ``DEPENDENCIES.txt`` file within this product for the
version after which the compatibility is OK.
