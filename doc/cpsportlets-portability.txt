A note on portability.
=====================

- Widgets
  -------
  CMF-compatible skins are stored in skins/cpsportlets_widgets.
  CPS3-specific skins are stored in skins/cpsportlets_widgets_cps3.
  Plone2-specific skins are stored in skins/cpsportlets_widgets_plone2.

  The CPS3 (or the Plone2) skin is installed on top of the CMF skin.


- Page templates / python scripts
  -------------------------------
  * The page templates are used for the presentation. They should be generic
    and cross-platform unless the presentation differs between platforms.

  * The python scripts are used to prepare the data that will be presented.

  Specific implementations (CPS3/Plone) should be done in the scripts not
  in the page templates. 

  For instance we write:

  showData.pt:
  ===========

  ...
  <div tal:define="data here/getData" tal:content="data/title" />
  ...
  
  with the getData.py file located in skins/cpsportlets_widgets, in
  skins/cpsportlets_widgets_plone2 and in skins/cpsportlets_widgets_cps3

  getData.py:
  ==========

  title = ...
  return {'title': title}


  Instead of:

  showData.pt:
  ===========

  <div tal:define="data here/getCPSData" tal:content="data/title" />
