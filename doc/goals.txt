CPSPortlets: Portlets engine for CPS3 -- goals:

- To unify the CPS3 architecture by using CPS Schemas and layouts
  for the portlets

- Full integration with CPSSkins

- Separation of two concepts : portlet content and portlet
  decoration and style (title bar etc...).  CPSSkins will take care
  of the second one.

- Refactoring the old portal_boxes machinery.

You may check ``CPSSkins/doc/CPS3-Integration.txt`` document from
Jean-Marc Orliaguet for further explanations on CPSSkins side.
