CPSPortlets : Portlets  engine for CPS3.

  - To unify the CPS3 architecture by using CPS Schemas and layouts for the
    portlets

  - Full integration with CPSSkins

  - Separation of two concepts : portlet content and portlet decoration and
    style (title bar etc...)
    CPSSkins will take care of the second one.

  - Cleaning the old portal_boxes and the use of the old boxe containers
    with the use of acquisition.
