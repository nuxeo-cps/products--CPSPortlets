New internal features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Removed obsolete widget types registration.
- Removed usless UniqueObject inheritance on PortletsCatalogTool
- #1077 more robust evalution of TAL expressions, for form validation
  and during the rendering of the page.
- better granularity for the portlet visibility: added a 'guard_check' option
  independent of 'visibility_check'. In the editor the guard check is disabled
  in WYSIWYG and in "Portlet slots" mode, the visibility check and the guard
  check are both disabled.
- defined a 'rpath_slash' variable in the portlet guard's expression context
  that contains the content path relative to the portal ending with a '/'
