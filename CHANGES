Requires:
~~~~~~~~~
-
New features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Navigation Portlet: several tree roots (sections, workspaces) can be
  specified.
- Added syndication for RSS Portlet, Content Portlet, Internal Links Portlet.
Bug fixes:
~~~~~~~~~~
- Removed warnings: replaces CMFCore.CMFCorePermissions by CMFCore.permissions.
- Added a fallback to CMF 1.4 for CMFCorePermissions since CPSPortlets is used
  on CPS-3.2.x instances.
- Action Portlet: updated the computed cache index to make it work with the
  CMF 1.5 action information representation.
- removed the 'wf_actions' cache parameter
  (it is a special case of actions:workflow)
- Document portlet, Content Portlet: added a fallback in case the 
  'layout_clusters' property is not set as a list.
- fine-tuned cache parameters
- the 'cache_timeout' portlet attribute was not updated according to the
  specified cache parameter.
- removed useless 'i18n' attribute for language-dependent portlets.
  These parameters are set site-wide in 'getPortletCacheParams.py'
- the cache timeout attribute is updated when the Custom Portlet gets edited
  and when it contains a 'timeout:...' custom cache parameter.
- portlet visibility: some invisible portlets were displayed.
- custom cache parameters are reset for global portlets too.
- getFolderItems.py did not work behind virtual hosts
New internal features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- optimized the portlets tool notify_event() method by not fetching the
  content of the notification object.
- using cluster 'metadata' instead of layout 'metadata'
- a layout cluster can be specified in the Content Portlet for rendering items.
- added an export infrastructure (rss, atom, etc.) for portlets that list items.
- added an RSS 1.0 / 2.0 exporter
