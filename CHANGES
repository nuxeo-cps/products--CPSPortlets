Bug fixes:

- Added a fallback to CMF 1.4 for CMFCorePermissions since CPSPortlets is used
  on CPS-3.2.x instances.
- Portal Actions: added 'user' as a cache parameter to make sure that their
  is a discrimination between different users (temporary fix).
New internal features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- optimized the portlets tool notify_event() method by not fetching the
  content of the notification object.
- using cluster 'metadata' instead of layout 'metadata'
- a layout cluster can be specified in the Content Portlet for rendering items.
